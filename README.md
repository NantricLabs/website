### An optimized tech stack for efficiency.

> This project was initially built to serve as an easy to deploy template, it has grown beyond that. 
>
> Here's a quick rundown of what's inside.
>
> **NextJS** offers a fast and seamless user experience, while **Directus** provides an easy-to-use admin dashboard for efficient database management. 
>
> By integrating **Tailwind CSS** into **NextJS**, we eliminate the need for constant file switching and ensure streamlined styling. 
>
> Test driven development is a must these days, so for that reason we've implemented **Cypress** natively within the tech stack.
>
> Many Quality-of-Life features have been implemented as well, this includes **Module path aliases** and the ability to use your own themes with **Tailwind**.
> 
> This results in a more efficient and beginner-friendly development environment.
